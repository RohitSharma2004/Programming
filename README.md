# Programming 🚀

Welcome to the **Programming** repository! This repository is designed to help track and improve coding skills by committing daily practice code.

## 📌 Purpose
- Maintain consistency in coding practice.
- Improve problem-solving skills.
- Build a personal coding portfolio.
- Track progress over time.

## 📁 Folder Structure
```
/programming
│-- YYYY-MM-DD/  # Daily folders with date format
│   ├── problem1.py  # Example problem
│   ├── problem2.js  # Another problem in JavaScript
│   └── notes.md  # Notes for the day
```

## 🚀 How to Contribute (For Personal Use)
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/programming.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd programming
   ```
3. Add your daily code inside a new folder (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
4. Stage, commit, and push your changes:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added daily practice for YYYY-MM-DD"
   git push origin main
   ```

## 🔄 Automation (Optional)
To automate daily commits, create a script like:
```sh
#!/bin/bash
cd /path/to/programming
git add .
git commit -m "Daily code update $(date +'%Y-%m-%d')"
git push origin main
```

Schedule this script using **cron (Linux/macOS)** or **Task Scheduler (Windows)** to auto-push code daily.

## 📊 Progress Tracking
- Maintain a log file (`progress.md`) to record daily learnings.
- Use GitHub insights to visualize contribution history.

## 🏆 Stay Consistent!
Happy Coding! 🚀👨‍💻👩‍💻
